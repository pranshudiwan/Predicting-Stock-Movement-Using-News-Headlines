# Predicting-Stock-Movement-Using-News-Headlines
Code, Report, Visualizations and EDA for the project. This project was done in the DS 5220 (Supervised Machine Learning) Class of Northeastern University, Spring 2020.

 We plan to predict the movement of the stock price using the news headlines and past DJIA index data. Through the course of the project, we have explored various techniques, analyzed and formulated them to build the best model for our case.
