# Predicting-Stock-Movement-Using-News-Headlines
Code, Report, Visualizations and EDA for the project. This project was done in the DS 5220 (Supervised Machine Learning) Class of Northeastern University, Spring 2020.

### Aim:
Our aim was to predict the movement of the stock price using the news headlines and past DJIA index data. Through the course of the project, we have explored various techniques, analyzed and formulated them to build the best model for our case.

### Data:
We had two tables: The DJIA index data and the Reddit news data. We combined both these sources into one table, containing the news headlines and the DJIA index, along with the market movement (0 for down, 1 for up).
